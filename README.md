# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Commitment

Starting May 24, 2021, I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days to improve my JavaScript skills. Additional rules:

1. I will [tweet](https://twitter.com/mariaionova) about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push the code to GitHub every day.
3. I will update the [Daily Log](#daily-log) section below with my daily progress and provide a link so others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent on tutorials, online courses, and other similar resources will _not_ count towards this challenge, but I can use the exercises if I code them myself before or after watching the solution.
5. I will allow myself to skip a day every two weeks if life gets in the way, but I'll need to add a day to the challenge for every day that I have skipped.
6. While solving the challenges, I will focus solely on JavaScript and use HTML/CSS only if the starter files are provided. Designing beautiful and usable interfaces will not be part of this challenge, but I will try to come back and revisit look & feel after the challenge is over.
