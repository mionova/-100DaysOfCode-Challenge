# 100DaysOfCode-Challenge

## Commitment

Starting May 24, 2021 I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days so that I can improve my JavaScript skills. Additional rules:

1. I will [tweet](https://twitter.com/mariaionova) about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the [Daily Log](#daily-log) section below with my daily progress and provide a link so others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will _not_ count towards this challenge but I can use the excercises for the challenge if I code them myself before watching the solution.
5. I am allowed to skip a day every two weeks if life gets in the way, but I will need to add a day to the challenge for every day that I have skipped.
6. While solving the challenges, I will be solely focused on JavaScript for now and will be using HTML/CSS if the files for that are provided. Designing beautiful and usable interfaces will be out of scope for this challenge but I will try to come back and revisit the look and feel after the challenger is over.

### Day 13 of 100
  
**Date**: June 5th, 2021
  
**Today's JavaScript Progress**: Mainly practiced writing conditions and ways to select and manipulate elements on the page (DOM basics). Solved the following challenges:

### Day 12 of 100
  
**Date**: June 4rd, 2021
  
**Today's JavaScript Progress**: Lightweight practice with functions, arrays and random numbers. Used JavaScript to create a function that grabs a random number from an array. And then I called that function a couple of times to simulate a dice roll game between two players.

### Day 11 of 100
  
**Date**: June 3rd, 2021
  
**Today's JavaScript Progress**: Refactored a bit and added the following features to the Random Quote Generator:

1. Auto-refreshed quotes using a timing function
2. When a new quote prints to the page, the background color changes to a random color.
3. Increased the quote object properties

### Day 10 of 100
  
**Date**: June 2nd, 2021
  
**Today's JavaScript Progress**: I finalized my Random Quote Generator

Currently, the app displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked and works as expected! I might try adding some bells and whistles over the next couple of days.

### Day 9 of 100
  
**Date**: June 1st, 2021
  
**Today's JavaScript Progress**: I made some progress on a little project: A Random Quote Generator

For this project, I'm creating an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. All quotes have a source but some also display citation and year.
