# 100DaysOfCode-Challenge

## Commitment

Starting May 24, 2021 I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days so that I can improve my JavaScript skills. Additional rules:

1. I will [tweet](https://twitter.com/mariaionova) about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the [Daily Log](#daily-log) section below with my daily progress and provide a link so others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will _not_ count towards this challenge but I can use the excercises for the challenge if I code them myself before watching the solution.
5. I am allowed to skip a day every two weeks if life gets in the way, but I will need to add a day to the challenge for every day that I have skipped.
6. While solving the challenges, I will be solely focused on JavaScript and will be using HTML/CSS if the files for that are provided. Designing beautiful and usable interfaces will be out of scope for this challenge.
