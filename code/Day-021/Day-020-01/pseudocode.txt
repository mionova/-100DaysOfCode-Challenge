Challenge - The What and Why of Pseudocode
******************************************/

/* Pseudocode for a simple specification */
Requirements:
Get two integer values from a user and output the sum of those numbers

prompt user for first number
if input is not a number
  print "input is not a number"
  prompt user for new number
endif
set num1 to ther user's input
prompt user for second number
if input is not a number
  print "input is not a number"
  prompt user for new number
endif
set num2 to ther user's input
set sum to num1 + num 2
print sum


/* Pseudocode for Loops */
Requirements: 
- Given a list of students, calculate their GPA
- The grading scale used should be 1-4
- If any grade isn't a 1,2,3 or 4 print a message and stop the program

retrieve studentGades
set grades to studentGrades
set gradeTotal to 0
for each grade in grades
    if grade is not a 1, 2, 3, or 4
        print "invalid grade"
        print grade
        print "can't complete calculation"
        stop
    else add grade to gradeTotal
    endif
endfor
set gpa to gradeTotal / number of grades
print gpa


/* Pseudocode for Functions */

Requirements: 
- Given a list of students, calculate their GPA
- The grading scale used should be 1-4
- If any grade isn't a 1,2,3 or 4 print a message and stop the program

  retrieve studentGrades
  set grades to studentGrades
  set gradeTotal to 0
  for each grade in grades
      if grade is not a 1, 2, 3, or 4
          print "invalid grade"
          print grade
          print "can't complete calculation"
          stop
      else add grade to grade_total
      endif
  endfor
  set gpa to gradeTotal / number of grades
  return gpa
endfunction
